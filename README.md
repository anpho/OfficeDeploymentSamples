Office Deployment Samples
=========================

This repo contains some sample xmls for ODT ( Office Deployment Tool ) .

## How to use

1. Download latest ODT from [Microsoft ODT](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/overview-office-deployment-tool), or use the setup.exe instead ( not recommanded )
2. Download sample xml to the same directory, e.g. `2019-ltsc.xml`
3. Open Terminal.
4. run `.\setup.exe /configure [path to some.xml]` <-- change to your xml path. e.g. `d:\setup.exe /configure d:\2019-ltsc.xml`
5. wait a moment, in my case, 1 minute.

## How to modify

The xml files could be opened with Notepad, but [Office Customizaion Tool](https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings) is much better.

## How to activate

I don't know :( , you can google it somewhere else.

Office Deployment Samples
=========================

This repo contains some sample xmls for ODT ( Office Deployment Tool ) .

## How to use

1. Download ODT from [Microsoft ODT](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/overview-office-deployment-tool)
2. Download sample to the same directory
3. run `.\setup.exe [path to some.xml]` <-- change to your xml

## How to modify

The xml files could be opened with Notepad, but [Office Customizaion Tool](https://config.office.com/deploymentsettings) is better.

## How to activate

I don't know, you can google it somewhere.
